## Introduction

Helping Doctors is a platform for both doctors as well as patients.

It is mainly targeted for people in remote areas in India who have to travel long distances to consult doctors.

For patients - A simple user friendly android application

For doctors - A web portal

Below are the doctor/1000 patient ratios: 

### • Germany 4.19 (2015)

### • USA 2.57 (2014)

### • India 0.76 (2016)

As you can see in India, the ratio is particularly low.

In today's world where everyone is using a smartphone and where there is an app for anything and everything, we want to provide a simple solution for this problem with the help of Agora RTC.

We have designed and developed a mobile app for the users (patients), using which they are only a click away from consulting a doctor of their choice.

The users can consult with the doctor though an audio or video call.

## Mobile Application (Android)

The android apk is present in the below location:

If you want to build the application yourself follow the below steps:

1. Create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://agora.io) and obtain an App ID.

2. Update "app/src/main/resources/values/strings.xml" with your App ID: 

 ```xml
 <string name="agora_app_id">YOUR_APP_ID</string>"
 ```
3. Build the app


## Future Scope

• A mobile application for doctors

• Group audio and video calls. For example - If my parents are staying in another state and I want to consult with a doctor along with     them

• A chat service so that patients have an option to chat with the doctors as well

• Multiple language support in app, so that everyone is able to use it without any hassle
